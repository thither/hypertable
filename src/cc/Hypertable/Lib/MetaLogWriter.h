     * is constructed with an initial set of entities to persist (obtained from
     * a prior read of the log) and is kept open during the duration of the
     * server process and is used to persist state changes by appending updated
     * Entity objects.  It is typically constructed as follows:
     * <pre>
     * MetaLog::Reader reader = new MetaLog::Reader(log_fs, definition, log_dir);
     * vector<MetaLog::EntityPtr> entities;
     * reader->get_entities(entities);

       * Initializes the writer by setting #m_path to <code>path</code> and
       * creating it if it doesn't exist.  It then initializes #m_backup_path
       * (creating it in the local filesystem if it does not exist) as follows:
       * <pre>
       * $data_dir     = Config::properties->get_str("Hypertable.DataDirectory");
       * $name         = m_definition->name();

       * m_backup_path = $data_dir/run/log_backup/$name/$backup_label
       * </pre>
       * It then scans the log directory with a call to scan_log_directory() to
       * obtain the current set of numeric file names in the log directory
       * (<code>path</code>) and the next unused numeric file name which is
       * stored in local variable, <i>next_id</i>.  Old log files are purged
       * with a call to purge_old_log_files() with a "keep count" of 30.
       * It then sets #m_filename equal
       * to  <code>path/next_id</code> and opens it for writing, setting
       * the #m_smartfd_ptr to the opened file descriptor.  The replication factor is
       * set to the <code>Hypertable.Metadata.Replication</code> property.  It
       * then sets #m_backup_filename to #m_backup_path + <code>\/next_id</code>
       * and opens it for writing (in the local filesystem), setting
       * #m_backup_fd to the opened file descriptor.  It then writes the file
       * header with a call to write_header() and persists
       * <code>initial_entities</code>.  Finally, it writes a RecoverEntity.
