DEPRECATION: Python 2.7 will reach the end of its life on January 1st, 2020. Please upgrade your Python as Python 2.7 won't be maintained after that date. A future version of pip will drop support for Python 2.7.
Requirement already up-to-date: thrift>=0.11.0 in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from -r requirements.txt (line 2)) (0.11.0)
Requirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: six>=1.7.2 in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from thrift>=0.11.0->-r requirements.txt (line 2)) (1.12.0)
